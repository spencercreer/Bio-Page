                <p> I was born in Castro Valley, California. I moved to Utah at age seven and have lived in Spanish Fork and Cedar Hills. I graduated with honors and a 4.0 GPA from Lone Peak high school.
                    At age nineteen, I served a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in southern Germany. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Brigham Young University.</p>
                <p>I have spent the majority of my career in business and sales roles. From 2014 to 2018, I worked as a sales manager for New Star Communications, an At&t and DirecTv dealer. I led sales teams in Texas, Missouri, and Ohio. After graduating from BYU, I have 
                    combined my sales and engineering background in multiple technical sales roles. I currently work as a Sales Engineer for Moxtek, Inc.
